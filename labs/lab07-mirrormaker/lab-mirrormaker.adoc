#This lab walks through 
a) setting up mirrormaker 
b) testing the setup to ensure that messages sent to one cluster are being replicated/mirrored in the mirrormaker target cluster.


#First we will create a "target" cluster. This will be the cluster that mirror maker writes to.
#Note: We will use the first cluster previously created in this workshop as the "source" cluster.

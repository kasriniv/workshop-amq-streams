This lab walks through 
a) setting up mirrormaker 
b) testing the setup to ensure that messages sent to one cluster are being replicated/mirrored in the mirrormaker target cluster.

We will use the first cluster previously created in this workshop as the "source" cluster.
We will create the mirror-maker "target" cluster.
 
Prerequisites:
1. You have 'my-cluster-kafka' installed per previous labs
2. You have 'my-topic' created per previous labs
3. Make sure you are logged in to Openshift with the oc client


Steps
Step 1: Run this to create the "target" cluster. This will be the cluster that mirror maker writes to.

oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasriniv/workshop-amq-streams/master/labs/lab07-mirrormaker/kafka-ephemeral-mtarget.yaml

Make sure the pods have come up fine.

Step 2: create the mirror maker configuration

oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasriniv/workshop-amq-streams/master/labs/lab07-mirrormaker/kafka-mirror-maker-lab.yaml

Make sure the pods have come up fine.


Testing
Step 1: 
Go to the Openshift webconsole->Applications->Pods and pick the my-cluster-mtarget-kafka-0
Go to the terminal and run
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
this will confirm that my-topic was created automatically
Send some messages to my-topic on my-kafka-cluster
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic

See these messages being replicated to my-topic on my-cluster-mtarget-kafka
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-mtarget-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic

Note that the topic was autocreated for you.


Challenge exercise
Now try to whitelist another topic in the mirrormaker configuration

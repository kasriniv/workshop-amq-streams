This lab walks through 
a) setting up mirrormaker 
b) testing the setup to ensure that messages sent to one cluster are being replicated/mirrored in the mirrormaker target cluster.

We will use the first cluster previously created in this workshop as the "source" cluster.
We will create the mirror-maker "target" cluster.
 
Prerequisites:
1. Please make sure you have my-cluster installed per previous labs
2. Make sure you are logged in to Openshift with the oc client

Step 1: Run this to create the "target" cluster. This will be the cluster that mirror maker writes to.

oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasriniv/workshop-amq-streams/master/labs/lab07-mirrormaker/kafka-ephemeral-mtarget.yaml

Step 2: create the mirror maker configuration

Note that we will create the basic objects by running this yaml and then edit the environment properties in the Openshift webconsole.




Open questions
1. Can I put multiple topics to sync? how? comma seperated? K to test
2. Do I have to precreate topics on target

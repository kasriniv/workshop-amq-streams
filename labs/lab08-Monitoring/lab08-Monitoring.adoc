This lab will be focus on the following: +
- Steps to create a cluster with metrics instrumented +
- Steps to create an instance of Prometheus and Grafana +
- Steps to import prebuilt kafka and zookeeper definitions +


The Grafana and Promethus instances that come with Openshift cannot be used for application monitoring.
And so, for this exercise, we will install our own instance of Prometheus and Grafana for kafka monitoring in the same namespace as the kafka cluster. In my case it is 'myproject'.

Step 1: Create a new kafka cluster with metrics instrumented  +
We create a new cluster with the  metrics instrumentation for to the new cluster : my-cluster3
We could have edited any existing cluster but chose to create a new one. 

  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasriniv/workshop-amq-streams/master/labs/lab08-Monitoring/kafka-cluster3-metrics.yaml


Step 2: Install Prometheus  +
To install Prometheus, we use instructions that are here: https://strimzi.io/docs/0.9.0/#kafka_metrics_configuration

  oc login -u system:admin

  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/0.9.0/metrics/examples/prometheus/kubernetes.yaml


Step 3: Create a route for the Prometheus service  +
Make sure your project is set to 'myproject' or whatever you are using throughout the labs.
  oc expose svc prometheus



Step 4: Install Grafana  +
  oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/0.9.0/metrics/examples/grafana/kubernetes.yaml



Step 5: Create a route for the Grafana service  +
Make sure your project is set to 'myproject' or whatever you are using throughout the labs.
  oc expose svc grafana

Step 6: Access the Grafana dashboard   +
  Get the route from 
  oc get routes
  It should be similar to : grafana-myproject.apps.<your id>.openshiftworkshop.com 
  Login as admin/admin to the Grafana dashboard on your browser with the URL from above . You can also change password to admin. 

Step 7: Create the prometheus datasource  +
  Go to the 'Gear' icon on the left and then pick Datasources
  Fill following values:
  name: prometheus
  type: prometheus
  url: (from the prometheus route like) http://prometheus-myproject.apps.<YOUR ID>.openshiftworkshop.com
  Save and Test. You should see a 'data source tested' message.

Step 8: Importing Dashboard definitions  +
  Go to the + on the top left and choose "import".
  Copy the JSON from this location
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/0.9.0/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-kafka.json
  Pick prometheus as the datasource and finish
  You should see the dashboard with data like in the screenshots.

  Similarly to create kafka-zookeeper dashboards, import the corresponding definition
  Go to the + on the top left and choose "import".
  Copy the JSON from this location
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/0.9.0/metrics/examples/grafana/strimzi-zookeeper.json
  Pick prometheus as the datasource and finish.
  You should see the dashboard with data like in the screenshots.
